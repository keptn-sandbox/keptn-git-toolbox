# keptn-gitops-operator

> **DISCLAIMER**: This project is a proof-of-concept and was developed and is not complete and not supported. The CRDs as well as the backing mechanisms may change over time. Please use with care (currently it didn't break anything)!

## Idea

This operator makes keptn (almost) configurable by git. It introduces Custom Resource Definitions for KeptnProjects and
KeptnServices.

If a Keptn Project CR is available, the operator tries to find the projects GitHub secret (as stored by keptn) and looks
for a `.keptn/config.yaml` file in the main branch of the repository.

## Installation

To run this from your machine and you already installed kubebuilder, use:

```shell
make install
make run
```

Otherwise (unless the installation mechanism is ready):

**A Helm Chart will be created soon**

Assign a lot of permissions to the default user (will be fixed when using helm):

```shell
kubectl create clusterrolebinding sa-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=<namespace>:default
```

Install Custom Resource Definitions:

```shell
make install
```

Run the operator:

```shell
kubectl run keptn-operator --image=keptncontrib/keptn-gitops-operator:0.0.1-dev-init --image-pull-policy='Always'
```

## Prerequisites

* The project is already added to keptn and a git upstream configured (
  see https://keptn.sh/docs/0.8.x/manage/git_upstream/)
* The operator is installed

## Usage:

To use the gitops operator you need knowledge about the keptn git repository (e.g. where keptn expects the helm charts
and a simple configuration file (.keptn/config.yaml in the main branch) which might look as follows:

```yaml
services:
  - name: "carts"
    triggerevent: "sh.keptn.event.dev.delivery.triggered"
    stage: "dev"
```

The main branch will be watched for changes. If there are changes, the deployment will be triggered using the event
specified under `services[*].name.triggerevent`. The services specified here will be created (and deleted) in keptn.

After checking in this file, a Custom Resource for the corresponding Keptn Project should be created:

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: keptn.operator.keptn.sh/v1
kind: KeptnProject
metadata:
  name: my-keptn-project
spec:
  project: my-keptn-project
```

After applying this, the services defined in the config file will be managed in a GitOps way and the events specified
will be triggered on a git push to the keptn configuration repository.

## Contributions

* If there are additional use-cases which might be covered, please raise a PR
* Every PR and other contributions are welcome
* If you have other questions, or ideas, just reach out via slack

## Known Issues

* Currently Services are created regardless if they exist or not, this leads to many "create" events shown in the
  keptn-bridge.
* When a branch changes, all services in this branch are deployed (which might not necessarily end up in a redeployment)
